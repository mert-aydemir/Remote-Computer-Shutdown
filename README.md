# Remote-Computer-Shutdown
Unstable Version 1.0

LAN-Remote-Computer-Control

A simple program for Remote Computer Control on LAN. Not professional.

I take no responsibility for any problems the codes may cause. Please carefully read the codes, and make adjustments to suit you before use.

This is a school project and i do not guarantee of this code is working.

You can freely use this codes. But i want to say that again : "I take no responsibility for any problems the codes may cause. Please carefully read the codes, and make adjustments to suit you before use."

If you want to use this codes with your own database, please add your pc name to ADO.NET connection string. I named the string that you need to change "PCNAME". If you change it with your name, you can use your database.

For any questions you can message me. I will try to answer them as soon as possible.

For any issue about codes and my English, i apologize.

Have Fun!
